# ButterCorp Ruby On Rails Twitter Clone

This project is the result of a ROR lesson (net book) about building a Twitter Clone. 
If you want to try it, it is very easy to understand (please refer to the credits section) for many reasons :
- Well **explained** (each step got clear understanding etc.) 
- It covers alot of modules, **code optimization, ROR shortcuts and BEST practices**
- Unit Testing is covered (!not in this repository (flame)!)
- **OneToMany - ManyToMany - Cascade - Model optimization** 
- Works with the latest versions of Rails 5.xx (I wrote this the 24th of September 2018)

# Credits

[Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/) is the **mastermind behind this cool lesson**. Thanks to his shared knowledge, I was able to perform a very good presentation (15/20), in spite of the fact that my Ruby professor does not provide any gifts - to be clear. 
Even if I realised 8/9 of this project in **one night**, **alone**, I understood alot and wasn't copypaste dumbly the code portions. It was a good (but unfortunately short) experience in ROR.

You can also **buy the book** if you want to have extra exercices and solutions and also to support **Mr Hartl** in his work.
